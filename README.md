# COVID-19 Data Exploration

There are different types of coronavirus that can infect humans and animals. A novel strain of coronavirus was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Since then, COVID-19 is controversial and people (including me) did not stop asking questions regarding the novel coronavirus.

In this Project, I aim to exploit python tools for data scinece in order to answer COVID-19 related questions including:

1. Which countries have the highest total cases/deaths toll?
2. Is the number of COVID-19 cases correlated with country population?
3. What is the case fatality rate?

In this repository you can find:
